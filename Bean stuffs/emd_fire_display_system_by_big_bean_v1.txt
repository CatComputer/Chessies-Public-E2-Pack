#[ Hello there.
This is a recreation of the EMD FIRE locomotive displays by, you guessed it, Big Bean.
It's the ultimate (and definitely not dumbed-down) version of FIRE for your viewing pleasures.

----VERY IMPORTANT STUFF----
This E2 (and some of my other projects) are hosted on this repo: https://github.com/CatComputer/Chessies-Public-E2-Pack/tree/main
Check it out once in a while for updates, ye?

If you have any suggestions or if you need help with something (that's NOT the setup... seriously, if you can't set this up on your own, you have bigger problems my guy), you can find me on
all the common discord servers (OR, NAT and FC&N) under the name 'das_bean'.

------------
Version log:
------------
V:102.11 - Fixed DP not showing any data, because yours truly forgot to copy 5 lines of code over.
--------
V:102.10 - The "holy shit"(tm) update. Rewrote the main framework of the display system and changed the coloring so that it now supports color-grading.
Biggest Change that you care about is that it now has distributed power control pages that work with Chessie's DP system... no need to thank me.
--------
V:102.05 - Fixed all of it (the price you pay for consistency).
--------
V:102.04 - Revamped the loading screen (again), it should be pretty realistic now.
--------
V:102.03 - Fixed the fonts being whack because EGP updated their default font.
--------
V:102.02 - So you know how the config says that you can change the units in-game? That's a feature now. Additionally changed the metric pressure units to kPa from bar (thanks West)
Whoops, finger slipped, added length counter as well. Merry Christmas!
--------
V:102.01 - Overhaul of basically every page, fixed some config stuff, cleaned up the old mess, added new loading screen for your pleasures ("wow you updated V1 no way")
--------
V:101.xx - So old I forgot
--------

Setup:
------
Basic wiring:
1. Slap this E2 somewhere (but DO make sure you've configured the system before you do)
2. Wire EGPMain and EGPSec to the primary and secondary displays, respectively
3. Wire RLCPT to the RLC (wow)
4. Wire Pod to the Pod controller (and make sure it's the POD entity, not "Create New")
5. Wire CtlTable to the control stand controller
6. Wire Battery to your output of choice (this will turn the displays on)

Additional wiring:
* FuelLevel is for displaying the amount of fuel in your unit (US gallons)
* Horn and Bell go to your horn and bell
* LoadShed is just for the indicator, basically pointless
* UnitOverride overrides the currently selected unit type, so that you can control their type from a remote button or whatever
* If you're using distributed power:
    - Wire DISTRIBUTED_POWER_DATA_BUS to the output of the controller
    - Wire DISPLAY_CONTROL_BUS to the controllers respective input


[THIS IS DEPRECATED AND MAY BE REMOVED IN THE FUTURE]
EOTD setup & wiring:
First off, you'll want to use the older titus' EOTD E2 (the one that doesn't work with the wireless HOTD thing).

It's quite straight forward afterwards:
1. Add an output called EOTDID
2. Add this block of code to the bottom of the E2:
    local IDS = toString(Skin1) + toString(Skin2) + toString(Skin3) + toString(Skin4) + toString(Skin5)
    EOTDID = IDS:toNumber()
3. Put a normal wire radio onto the EOTD with at least two values (can be more but they won't be used). Channel can be left at 1 because it'll get overwritten anyway.
4. Next, put a second wire radio into your locomotive with, again, two values

>>EOTD side radio wiring setup:
1. EOTDPsi goes to input 1 on the radio
2. EOTDID goes to input 2 on the radio
3. EOTD's BrakePipe input goes to output 1 on the radio
4. EOTD's MPH input goes to output 2 on the radio

>>Locomotive side radio wiring setup:
1. RX_EOTPSI goes to output 1 on the radio
2. RX_EOTID goes to output 2 on the radio
3. RX_EOTBrakePipe goes to input 1 on the radio
4. RX_EOTMPH goes to input 2 on the radio
